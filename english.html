       <h2> Essay</h2>
       Its been seven distressing days since the Russia and Ukraine war started. I haven’t been doing quite well mentally and physically. I’m isolated in a bunker with 15 more people. Anxiety takes over as we hear gunshots and explosions along with screams of the people who are dying an atrocious and agonising death while we can’t help but break down in tears. 
       After spending 7 nights in the shelter, things started to get very mundane, I started to google out things about world war 1 and about how it ended, slowly letting my inquisitiveness and curiosity take place.
       I went through  some books which mentioned World War One. I read that world war 1 took lives of more than 9 million soldiers, 21 million were wounded. World war 1 mostly affected France and Germany causing mass of loss. It took four years for world war 1 to end that is, 1914-1918.  Soldiers lived in trenches  and were always surrounded by danger. World war 1 ended when Germany surrendered and gave up on war back in 1918. After reading all this information I concluded one thing, “ Why can’t one country surrender and stop the war, how can one celebrate victory when all the fighters and winners give their life in war, and why can’t we all leave in peace?” And that struck me. I was lost in my thoughts for so long debating myself upon what I just read.  Whatever may be the cause of war, the outcome always remains the same, thousands of people die, families get deported to other countries forced to leave their homes and many children even lose their parents. Even if one country wins, it’s useless without winners. I’m not siding with either of the countries, but let’s just say that declaring war is not the solution, it’s never the solution. If people enter into a disagreement, they should rather try to talk out things so that we all can experience tranquility
